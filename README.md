# ðŸ’° Krabs
Krabs is a full-stack trial app for simple expense tracking, built with Spring Boot and Vue.js. The `krabs-api` backend provides an API for managing their finances while allowing me to gain a solid understanding of Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT Authentication, and Reactive Programming with Spring WebFlux. It includes user authentication with JWT and simple CRUD features for managing expenses.
